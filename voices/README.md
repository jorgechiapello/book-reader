# Voices Folder

Place voice samples here. The importer can create a structure like:

```
voices/
  moz_speaker/
    sample.mp3
    clips/
      clip_001.mp3
      clip_002.mp3
    LICENSE.txt
```

If you use public datasets (like Mozilla Common Voice), keep the attribution
and license text in the voice folder (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`) to stay compliant.
